# Decentralized-storage-system-using-blockchain
The objective of a decentralized storage system using blockchain is to provide a secure and
decentralized way of storing and retrieving data. Traditional centralized storage systems have
some drawbacks, such as data breaches, data loss, and single points of failure. By using a
decentralized storage system, these drawbacks can be addressed, and the data can be made more
secure and available.
